# Weather App

## __Description__

**Motivation:**
The Weather App was developed with the motivation to provide users with a quick and accessible tool to check real-time weather conditions in different cities. It aims to enhance user convenience and help them make informed decisions based on weather forecasts.

**Purpose:**
The Weather App was created to offer a simple way for users to access up-to-date weather information for specific cities. It addresses the need for a user-friendly application that enables users to plan their activities based on current weather conditions.

**Problem it Solves:**
The Weather App solves the problem of quickly obtaining accurate weather information for designated cities. Instead of manually searching for weather updates online, users can input a city's name into the app and receive immediate access to temperature, humidity, and wind speed data. This streamlines the process of gathering weather-related information.

**Learning Experience:**
While building this project, I gained insights into several key areas:
- **API Integration:** I acquired experience in integrating external APIs to retrieve and display data within the application.
- **DOM Manipulation:** I learned how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript to dynamically update app content based on user input and API responses.
- **Debugging:** I developed debugging skills by identifying and rectifying issues within the code, such as incorrect API request URLs.
